cwtest folder is the one containing the requested modules.

>> cwtest.types: container for the two classes who implement the algorithm.
  >> cwtest.types.Rover: a class defining a rover
  >> cwtest.types.RoversHandler: a class defining a handler for all rovers, who receives input from outside as lines
     and processes it accordingly.
>> cwtest.tests: container for all tests related to the algorithm. The test case defined there is the one described in the mail.

To run unit tests, I used "nosetests" under a virtualenv I created using "mkvirtualenv", under the condition that requirements
are installed (the only one needed is actually nose itself).
